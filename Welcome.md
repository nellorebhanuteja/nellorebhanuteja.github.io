Welcome to the IIIT Theory Group
================================

We are just a bunch of people who are fascinated about science and technology, and want to learn the theoretical roots behind it.
Our primary mode of discussions is the Discord Server. Ask a moderator or a batchmate for an invite!

We started out as a small group, consisting of about 10 people who explored a couple of topics in weekly meets. Within a few years the group expanded and now we have over 50 active members and 150 verified users! At first glance the server might seem too daunting, but fear not! We are all very welcoming people who are more than happy to have more theory enthusiasts join us in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding!
